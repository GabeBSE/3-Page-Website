                    Kennen, in my opinion, is one of the best champions to play. His game role is a mage that engages in
                    ranged fights. He throws a shuriken from a distance. You can build his abilities any way you choose to fit
                    your game style. You can build him as attack damage, carry, or a support tanky build by using the build
                    items available inside the "in-game" store using the gold you earn throughout the match.
        
                    But it is best to build Kennen as a mage, which is what his role is supposed to be. His abilities are
                    magic-based, so any magic items you buy that have added magic will increase Kennen's special abilities.
        
                    Throughout the match, your team as well as the enemy team will be building their champions, increasing their
                    health and whatever role-based abilities they have. With the proper build and used correctly, Kennen could
                    be very dangerous in a one-on-one battle or even in a group battle.

                    <ul class="ability-list">
                        <li><b><u><i>Passive: Mark Of The Storm</i></u></b>: Kennen stuns enemies he hits 3 times with his abilities.</li>
                        <li><b><i><u>Thundering Shuriken</u></i></b>: Kennen throws a fast-moving shuriken towards a location, causing 
                            damage and adding a Mark of the Storm to any opponent that it hits.</li>
                        <li><b><i><u>Electrical Surge</u></i></b>: Kennen passively deals extra damage and adds a Mark of the Storm to 
                            his target every few attacks, and he can activate this ability to damage and add another Mark of the Storm 
                            to targets who are already marked.</li>
                        <li><b><i><u>Lightning Rush</u></i></b>: Kennen morphs into a lightning form, enabling him to pass through units 
                            and apply a Mark of the Storm. Kennen gains Move Speed when entering this form, and attack speed when 
                            leaving it.</li>
                        <li><b><i><u>Slicing Maelstrom</u></i></b>: Kennen summons a storm that strikes at nearby enemy champions for 
                            magical damage.</li>
