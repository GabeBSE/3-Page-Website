        </div>  

        <p>
            League of Legends is a free online multiplayer battle arena video game. It was released on October 27, 2009 by 
            Riot Games. It is available to play on Microsoft Windows and macOS.

            Players can select characters known as "champions". Each champion has a specific role and specific set of abilities to
            play in the game, but it is up to the player to choose how they will use the champion in game.
            
            The champion roles are Attack Dammage Carry (ADC), Mage, Jungler, and Tanks. Some champions can also be a hybrid.
            ADC's abilities are based off attack damage. Mage's abilities are based off of magic. Jungler abilities can be attack
            damage, magic based, or a mixture as well as Junglers and Tanks.
            
            The main game mode, is called Summoner's Rift. The map layout is a daimond shaped with main
            fighting paths located at top, middle, and bottom. This mode is a 5v5 team death match. Throughout the match, champions will
            gain levels by gathering experience points (XP) by killing enemies.
            
            Gold is also earned through kills, assist and taking down
            enemy structures. You can use the gold earned to buy build items through a in game shop menu. The items will help build your champion's abilities, health, armor, and magic resist.
        
            It has recieved many great reviews from different popular gamming magazines. League of Legend's popularity is big in 
            the gamming community. Riot Games has made it possible to play internationally. There are cash prize competitions
